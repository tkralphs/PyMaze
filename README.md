PyMaze
======

A simple maze generator, solver, and interactive explorer for use in the classroom. This code was originally written to be used as part of an undergraduate lab in the course IE172, Algorithms in Systems Engineering at Lehigh University. The Lab writeup and materials can be found here:

To use this, you need to first easy_install

pygame
coinor.blimpy

I have more code that I am not posting here because it is part of the solution the students are supposed to code. Please feel free to contact me if you are an instructor and want more information.
